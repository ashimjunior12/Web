The CSS property `display: inline-block;` is used to make an element behave like an inline-level element while allowing you to set a width, height, padding, and margin for it, similar to a block-level element. It's a combination of two different display values: `inline` and `block`.

When you apply `display: inline-block;` to an element, it will:

1. Behave like an inline-level element: This means it will flow along with the content and not force a line break after it, just like a regular inline element (e.g., `<span>` or `<a>`).

2. Allow you to set width and height: Unlike regular inline elements, you can specify the width and height of the element. This gives you more control over the element's size.

3. Respect padding and margin: You can also apply padding and margin to the element, which will affect how other elements interact with it.

Here's an example of how you might use `display: inline-block;` in CSS:

HTML:
```html
<div class="box">This is an inline-block element.</div>
```

CSS:
```css
.box {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 5px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

In this example, the `.box` element will behave like an inline element, allowing other content to flow around it, but it will also have a width, height, padding, and margin, just like a block-level element. This combination of properties makes it useful for creating inline elements with specified dimensions or spacing around them.
