{} means going back to JavaScript

value inside {} must be expression (i.e that returns a value), rather than statements.

Example :- 

const name = "Danish"

function Name(){
	return <p>{name}</p>
};

we will get the desired output, but

function Name(){
	return <p>{let x=6}</p>
}

we will get an error.	

So every time we want to go back to JS, we set up the curlies and start our logic inside of it.
