Two flavours while it comes to import and export
- named one and default one



We can use whichever we prefer

Most probably if we have one component in a file we use default one and if we have multiples they will
be named.


When we import with the named one, we need to use the same name.

And with the default one, we can come up with whatever value we want.


Syntax for named import:- 

----------------------------
export.js
export const name = "Hari";

main.js
import {name} from "./export"  

----------------------------

Syntax for default import:- 
----------------------------
export.js

const name = "Ram";

export default name;

// we can only export a single default from the file.

main.js

import whatever_name_we_want from export.js

Inside the code, we have to specify the name

--------------------------------------------



They help to organize our application
