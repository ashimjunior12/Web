`useCallback` and `useMemo` are similar in that they both memoize values to optimize performance, but they serve different purposes:

1. **Purpose**:
   - `useCallback`: Memoizes functions, specifically callback functions. It's useful when passing callbacks to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders of those components.
   - `useMemo`: Memoizes the result of a function. It's useful for optimizing expensive calculations or operations, ensuring that they are only recalculated when their dependencies change.

2. **Return value**:
   - `useCallback`: Returns a memoized callback function.
   - `useMemo`: Returns the memoized value/result of a function.

3. **Usage**:
   - `useCallback`: Typically used when you need to pass a callback to child components, especially when the callback depends on some props or state values. It's handy for optimizing event handlers and similar callback functions.
   - `useMemo`: Typically used for memoizing the result of expensive calculations or operations. It's useful for optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary recalculations.

4. **Dependencies**:
   - `useCallback`: Accepts an optional dependency array, which, when provided, ensures that the callback function is only recreated if the values in the dependency array change.
   - `useMemo`: Accepts a dependency array, and it recalculates the memoized value only if one of the dependencies has changed. If the dependency array is empty, the value is calculated only once and remains the same throughout component re-renders.

In summary, `useCallback` is specifically tailored for memoizing callback functions, while `useMemo` is more general-purpose and is used for memoizing the result of any kind of function. Both are tools for optimizing performance in React applications.
