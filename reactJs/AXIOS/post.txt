Post request:-

For a POST request, supplying headers might be necessary depending on the requirements of the API you're interacting with. Here's why you might need to include headers in a POST request:

1. **Content-Type Header**: When you send data in the body of a POST request, it's important to specify the format of the data being sent. This is done using the `Content-Type` header. Common values for this header include `application/json` for JSON data, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for form data, and `multipart/form-data` for multipart form data (such as file uploads).

2. **Authorization Header**: If the API requires authentication, you would typically include an `Authorization` header containing authentication credentials. This might be a token, a username/password combination, or some other form of authentication.

3. **Other Custom Headers**: Depending on the specific requirements of the API you're working with, you might need to include additional custom headers. These could be used for various purposes such as rate limiting, content negotiation, or specifying the API version.

Here's an example of how you might include headers in a POST request using Axios:

```javascript
const postData = {
  // Data to be sent in the POST request body
  key1: 'value1',
  key2: 'value2'
};

const config = {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    // Other custom headers if required
  }
};

try {
  const response = await axios.post(url, postData, config);
  console.log(response.data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.response);
}
```

In this example:

- The `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json` to indicate that the data being sent in the request body is JSON.
- The `Authorization` header is included with a bearer token. Replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'` with your actual access token if the API requires authentication.
- Additional custom headers can be included in the `headers` object as needed.
