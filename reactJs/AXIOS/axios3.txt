**Global Axios Instance Setup:**
- The global Axios instance allows for setting default configurations that apply to all requests made with Axios throughout the application.
- One example is setting default request headers using `axios.defaults.headers`.
- The advantage is that these defaults are automatically applied to every request without explicitly specifying them each time.
- However, there are potential downsides, such as headers being sent with requests that don't need them or exposing sensitive information.

**Custom Axios Instance Setup:**
- A custom Axios instance is created to provide more control over specific requests.
- This involves creating a new Axios instance with `axios.create()` and configuring it with specific options like `baseURL` and custom headers.
- The advantage is that these configurations only apply to requests made with the custom instance, offering more granular control.

**Interceptors:**
- Interceptors are functions that Axios calls for every request and response, allowing for transformations or custom logic.
- Request interceptors can modify the outgoing request, such as adding headers, while response interceptors can handle the response data or errors.
- Interceptors are set up using `axios.interceptors.request.use()` and `axios.interceptors.response.use()`.
- They can be applied to both global and custom instances, providing flexibility in request and response handling.

**Conclusion:**
- Understanding how to set up global and custom Axios instances, along with utilizing interceptors, is crucial for effective HTTP request handling in applications.
- Global instances provide default configurations for all requests, while custom instances offer more specific control.
- Interceptors allow for additional logic or transformations to be applied uniformly across requests and responses.
