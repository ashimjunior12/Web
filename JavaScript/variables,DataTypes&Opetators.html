        <p><b>var keyword</b>:- It is used to declare a variable in JavaScript. Example:- var a. In this case, we have created a variable named 'a' using var keyword.</p> <br>
        <em>- Two types of operators in JavaScript:-</em>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Unary Operator</b>:- Has only one operand. Example, a=-1;, In this case - is operator and 1 is operand.</li> <br>
                <li><b>Binary Operator</b>:- Has two operands. Example, a=1+2, a=b+c.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
           <em> - Some Arthmetic operators: </em>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Exponentiation Operator</b>(**):- It is used to raise a number to a certain power. Example:- 'base ** exponent', ie, 2**3. In this case 2 is raised 3 times and the final output is 8.
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                <b>Increment/Decrement Operator(++/--)</b>:- In JavaScript, the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1, respectively. Example:- <br><br>
                <div class="code"> var num1=6; <br> num1++; <br> console.log(num1);</div> <br><br> The output is 7 cause the value of num1 is increased by 1. The value is decreased by 1 while using decrement operator. <br>
                <br>
                Now let's observe a slight difference between num1++ and ++num1. <br>
                <br><br> <div class="code"> num1 = 6; <br>console.log(++num1); </div><br> <br> In this case, we will get the output as expected.i.e. 7. <br> However, in this case, <br><br> <div class="code"> num1=6;<br>console.log(num1++);</div><br><br> The output is 6. The reason is simple. First the number is printed (i.e, initial value,6) after that the number is increased by 1 and then, num1 is updated as num1=7;
            </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

            <em>-More on <b>Binary Operators:-</b></em>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Arithmetic Operators</b>:- Use to perform mathmetical operations. Example:- '+', '-', '/', '*', '%'.</li> <br>
                <li><b>Assignment Operators</b>:- Assigns values from right side operands to the
                    left side operand. <br><br> Example:- Addition Assignment (+=). <br><br> Addition Assignment adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the value to the left operand.
                    <br>
                    <p class="code">
                        var y = 10; <br> y += 3; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;//Now the value of y is 13.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><p><b>Comparison Operators or Relational Operators</b>:- Used in programming to compare values and determine the relationship between them. These operators return a Boolean value (true or false) based on whether the comparison is true or false. 
                <br><br>Example:-  < , >, <=, >=, ==, !=</p></li>
                <li><b>Binary Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)</b></li>
                <li><b>Binary Bitwise Operators (&, ^, |)</b></li>
            </ol>
