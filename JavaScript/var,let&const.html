    <h1>var, let and const</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><b>var:-</b> <br>
            var is globally scoped or function/locally scoped. It's value can be accessed from everywhere. <br>But when it is declared within a function, it's value can only be accessed within that function.
            <p class="code">
                var string = "this is a string"; <br>//It's value can be accessed and updated from anywhere.
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                var string = "hello";  <br>
                function newFunction() {<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; var hello = "hello"; <br>
                } <br>
                console.log(hello); &emsp;&emsp; error: hello is not defined.
            </p>
            var can be re-declared and updated. <br>
            <p class="code">
                var string = "this is a string"; <br>
                string = "this is another one" &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;//value of string gets updated
                <br>var string = "this is a new string" &emsp;//string can be re-declared, which alredy existed
            </p>
            var variables are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with a value of undefined.
            <p class="code">
                console.log(name); <br>
                var name = "My name is ram";
            </p>
            is interpreted as:-
            <p class="code">
                var name; <br>
                console.log(name); <br>
                var name = "My name is ram";<br>
                console.log(name); &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;//undefined

            </p>
            Problem with var:- 
            <p class="code">
                var name = "my name is ram";
                <br>var times = 3; <br>
                if(times &lt; 4){<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;var name = "my name is hari";
               <br> } <br>
               console.log(name); &emsp;//"my name is hari" <br>
            <br>
            if(true){ <br>
                console.log(name); &emsp; //my name is hari <br>
            }
            </p>
            With the above code, the problem is, whenever we want the name, value of name is updated as "my name is hari", everywhere.
        </li>
        <br><br>
        <li>
        <b>let:- </b><br>
            let is block scoped. Its value can be accessed within its block only.
            <p class="code">
                let name = "my name is ram";
                <br>if(true){
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;let greet = "hello";<br>
                }
                <br>console.log(greet); &emsp;&emsp;//greet is not defined.            </p>
                let can be updated but can't be redeclared(within its scope).
                <p class="code">
                    let name = "my name is ram";
                    <br>name = "my name is hari"; &emsp;&emsp;//value of name is updated
                    <br>console.log(name);&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;//my name is hari
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    let name = "my name is ram";<br>
                    let name = "my name is hari";<br>
                    console.log(name); &emsp;&emsp;//error cause name has already been declared
                </p>
                but same varibale can be defined in different scopes
                <p class="code">
                    let name = "my name is ram";
                    <br>
                    if(true){ <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;let name = "my name is hari"; <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;console.log(name) &emsp;&emsp;//my name is hari
                    <br>
                    } <br>
                    console.log(name); &emsp;&emsp;//my name is ram
                </p>
                <b>Hoisting of let:- <br></b>
                let are hoisted at top, however let keyword is not initialized.
                <p class="code">
                    console.log(greeting); &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;//Refrence Error<br> 
                    greetng = "hello";
                </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>const:- </b><br>
            variable declared with const keyword maintain constant value throughout the entire program. <br>
            const are block scoped.
            <br><br>
            const can neither be updated nor be re-declared.
            <p class="code">
                const greeting = "hello"; <br>
                greeting = "hi" &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;//greeting cannot be updated
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                const greeting = "hello";
                <br>
                const greeting = "hi"&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;// greeting cannot be re-delcared.
            </p>
            properties of const object can be updated.
            <p class="code">
                const greeting{
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                    message = "hello"; <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                    times = 4;
                    <br>
                }
            </p>
            we can do:- 
            <p class="code">
                greeting.message = "say hi"; &emsp;&emsp;//This will update the value message of greeting.
            </p>
            <b>Hoisting of const:- </b> <br>
            Just like var and let, const is hoisted at the top but its value is not initialized.
